# GOAL OF THIS PROJECT 

PERFORMING SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ON FUEL CONSUMPTION

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Banbanli is an Automotive Manufacturer based in India. They produce wide range of cars in numbers and qualities. The engine performance in the cars they produce 
is a function of the Vehicle Horse Power. 

Rising from the meeting of highest level management of Banbanli, they decided to investigate the relationship between a Volume of Vehicle Horse Power and it's Fuel
Consumption. 

Bulk of the work falls on the lap of Dan, who is their in-house Data Scientist. 

Dan decides to create a model that would investigate the relationship, and make some predictions.

He then proceeds to gather dataset that guide his journey

# DATASET CONTENT

Dan was able to gather dataset (FuelEconomy.csv)for Vehicle Horse Power in relation to Fuel Consumption. 

In the dataset, we have two columns. Horse Power column, which represents the amount of Horse Power in different types of cars Banbanli produces. 
Fuel Economy (Milleage Per Gallon (MPG)) column, which represents the miles that would be convered per gallon of fuel if other factors that could affect it's 
movement remain constant. 

There is 100 rows in the dataset. These represent the values of both HP and FE in different types of cars

    X (independent variable) => Vehicle Horse Power
    Y (dependent variable) => Fuel Economy (MPG)
